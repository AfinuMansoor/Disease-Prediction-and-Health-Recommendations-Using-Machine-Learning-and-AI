# Disease-Prediction-and-Health-Recommendations-Using-Machine-Learning-and-AI
In this project, I developed a an integrated healthcare system designed to predict and manage three prevalent diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and liver disease. Utilizing the XGBoost machine learning algorithm, the system effectively classifies individuals as healthy or at risk for these conditions. To enhance the interpretability of the model, we incorporated the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) algorithm to identify and display features that contribute significantly to the prediction, focusing on those with an impact of more than 50%.
Furthermore, the system integrates a Hugging Face API via LangChain to provide personalized health recommendations aimed at maintaining optimal levels of the key features and symptoms identified. This recommendation component aids users in managing their health proactively.
The entire system is accessible through a user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit, ensuring ease of use and accessibility. Python served as the primary programming language for developing this project, leveraging its robust libraries and frameworks for machine learning and web development. This healthcare recommendation system aims to support individuals in understanding their health risks and taking preventive measures by offering insights and personalized advice based on their symptoms and health data.
